Project Description:

Exhibition Curator is a web application that allows users to create virtual exhibitions from the combined catalogues of museums. Designed for researchers, students, and art lovers, the platform enables users to search, filter, and curate exhibitions using real data from the Harvard Art Museums and The Metropolitan Museum of Art APIs.

Users can enter search terms or use preset filters to discover artworks, then select and save their favourites into a personalised exhibition that persists for the duration of their session. Each curated exhibition displays high-quality images and detailed information about the selected artworks, with direct links to museum websites for further exploration.

The application features:

- Search and filter exhibitions
- Save artworks into a temporary, session-based collection that can be viewed and expanded.
- Display images and core information for each artwork, with interactive exhibition cards.
- Clear navigation and user feedback, including error messages and loading indicators.
- Responsive design and accessibility considerations for use on any device.
- Fast loading of media content and clear communication of loading states.

This software requires Node.js version 18 or above to work effectively.
